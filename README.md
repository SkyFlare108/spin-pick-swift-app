# 🎰 Spin & Pick — Safari Extension

**Spin & Pick** helps you decide where to go by turning Google search results into a fun roulette wheel. Search something like **“restaurants near me”**, let the extension pick the top 5 places, and spin to let fate choose your next spot. 😎

## 🔥 How It Works

1. **Search on Google**: Go to **google.com** and run a local search (e.g., “coffee near me”, “parks in Seattle”, “best sushi Bellevue”).
2. **Pick Suggestions**: The extension reads Google’s place suggestions/results and **selects up to 5** names.
3. **Spin the Wheel**: Click the extension icon to open the roulette wheel.
4. **Let It Decide**: Spin to randomly choose where to go. 🎯
